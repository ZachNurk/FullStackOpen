## Structure
Each part is organized into its own folder, typically like:
- `part0/`
- `part1/`
- `part2/`
- ...

Some parts contain multiple exercises/projects inside the part folder.

## How to Run (most parts)
Many parts are separate apps. In general:

```bash
cd partX/some-app
npm install
npm run dev
